### Inline Text Editing [VERSION] Change Log
### [DATE]
### Corey Hart @ http://www.codenothing.com

# New Features
-Added revert hook to revert the current text back to it's starting position at first view
-Added postFormat setting to control post data sent to the server on each request
-Enhanced load functionality, can now control the data recieved from the server and do custom insertion
-Can now control the type of request sent to the server (GET or POST)
-Now preventing multiple inlineEdit initiations on the same wrapper element.

# Possible Breaks
-load function has changed completely, it gets passed 2 arguments, the event object that triggered the request,
and a ui object holding the response and settings.
